# Per-Sample C: a live-coding environment for audio programming

This project depends on the Tiny C Compiler so it supports C only. For compiling
C++, we refer you to the Per-Sample C++ project which uses clang and the LLVM
compiler infrastructure.

## TODO

We should add a bunch of built-in functions like those offered by GLSL,
GenExpr, Puredata, Max, and SuperCollider.
